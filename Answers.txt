Q1. Describe the main differences between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?

Ans :-
Differences between Flexbox layout and Grid layout:
(a). Flexbox layout : Flexbox used  Primarily a one-dimensional layout model. It is designed for laying out items in a single direction, either as a row or a column. Works along either the row or column axis, allowing for the creation of layouts in a single direction.

(b). Grid layout: Grid used for a two-dimensional layout model that enables you to create layouts with both rows and columns simultaneously. Works along both the row and column axes simultaneously, providing greater control over both dimensions.

=> Use Cases of Flexbox and Grid layout:

Flexbox:Use Flexbox when dealing with a single dimension (row or column) and for simpler, more linear layouts.

Grid:Use Grid when dealing with two dimensions (rows and columns) and for more complex layouts requiring precise control over both dimensions.

(a). justify-content : This is the CSS property used in flexbox to control the alignment of flex items on the main axis in the flex container. 

(b). align-items : This is the CSS property used in flexbox to control the alignment of flex items on the cross axis in the flex container. 

(c). gap : gap property in flexbox model is used to give gap (spacing) between the flex container items.

(d). flex-direction : flex-direction property is used to define the direction of the flex container items, which ultimately decides the main axis and cross axis.

(e). flex-wrap : flex-wrap property defines if the flex items is adjusted on multiple lines if there is not much space.
